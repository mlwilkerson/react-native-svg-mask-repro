# react-native-svg-sandbox

1. install node, watchman, and XCode, per [Getting Started instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) in React Native docs
1. clone this repo
1. `yarn install`
1. `yarn start` # in one terminal tab
1. `yarn ios` # in another terminal tab, will launch iOS Simulator and load Hello app

When making changes to `App.js`, just `Command+R` in the Simulator to reload the JavaScript bundle (don't need to rebuild the iOS app with `yarn ios` for those changes).
